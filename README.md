<h>3D Remake of Tron</h>
<hr>

This is a 3D remake in Unity3D of the game Tron. It's not finished, there is still quite a bit of work to be done:

My list of wants for this game, if anyone can help, please do it would certainly be appreciated:
- I want it to have the Recognizers and the grids scenery above from the Tron movie
- The enemy AI needs to be coded
- Sound effects for the light cycles
- VR capability would be wonderful
- It would be wonderful to have 3 on 3 teams, 3 players cooperative against the AI 
- Effects for the collision
- The tanks possibly, they were in parts in Tron 2.0
- Oh I had ideas of remaking the other games from the arcade version like the grid bugs, the MCP fight, the Discs of Tron, a new game for the Solar Sails, oh yeah, had some pretty excessive ones in there, but when you've been working 

Tron is copyrighted by Disney, this is sort of a fan remake of the light cycles game. Plenty of folks make remakes like this. I'm just spreading the love and good ideas. I see all these folks today working on the zombie type games, yikes. Let's please not forget the things that made gaming good. Walt and Roy Disney, they made something wonderful and fantastic. 

Cannot gaming also be a message to spread about love? There are times that you are plentiful and I am in need, there are times when I am plentiful and you are in need. I was not just a programmer at companies, but I helped at the food pantry, I helped donate to the Goodwill and the Salvation Army. I took steps of courage that were difficult.

Maybe Disney could get behind this and I would hope help us out a little, sure I was a computer programming contest team winner out at AT&T back in 2015, but these days I'm on hard times I'm on medical disability when what I've wanted most was to be a husband and father, and the maximum the SGA allows is $1200 a month, I've had a hard time finding work that won't work me to death, and I need a breather financially, so does my mother and father they're getting ready to retire.

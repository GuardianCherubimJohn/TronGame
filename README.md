This is a 3D remake in Unity3D of the game Tron. It's not finished, there is still quite a lot of work to be done.

My list of wants for this game, if anyone can help, please do it would certainly be appreciated:

- I want it to have the Recognizers and the grids scenery above from the Tron movie
- The enemy AI needs to be coded
- Sound effects for the light cycles
- VR capability would be wonderful
- It would be wonderful to have 3 on 3 teams, 3 players cooperative against the AI 
- Effects for the collision
- The tanks possibly, they were in parts in Tron 2.0
- I had ideas of remaking the other games from the arcade version like the grid bugs, the MCP fight, the Discs of Tron, a new game for the Solar Sails

Tron is copyrighted by Disney, this is sort of a fan remake of the light cycles game. Plenty of folks make remakes like this. I'm just spreading the love and good ideas. 

I see all these folks today working on these zombie type games, yikes. 

Let's please not forget the things that made gaming good. Walt and Roy Disney made something wonderful and fantastic. 

Cannot gaming also be a message to spread about love? If you're bored, feel free to jump in and help, it could also be a good learning project. I already contacted Disney and their automated response said that they are not taking new idea submissions, of course they are also busy with the opening of the new Star Wars rides at Disneyland and Disney World theme parks, and even despite this response, I still like Disney.
